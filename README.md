# NewsNet

1. To display the results, you must create a conda environment using the requirements.txt file

2. To run the NewsNet.ipynb notebook using Google Colab, it is necessary to load the spacy_component.py file in the temporary files

The goal of this project is to develop a system capable of extracting entities and relationships from news articles and displaying them in a Knowledge Graph. Through this Knowledge Graph, the information in the articles will be organized and structured, allowing concepts to be linked through explicit relationships. This structure facilitates understanding the connections between data, enhancing the ability to extract useful information and answer complex questions. The system will leverage the Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) capabilities of certain Large Language Models (LLMs).
